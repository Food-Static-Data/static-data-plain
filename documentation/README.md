---------------


- [ ] add link to git or to Medium article - Food Machine Learning collection

- [ ] Create an OSS section, about what we're coding

Docs        Set of major projects
Fetch       Recipe Api
Plans       Grocery list api
etc


- [ ] Improve readme
- [ ] explain how to use playground for testing purposes

#### [documentation][tasks]

 3) separate methods into different files, stored in one folder and connected to the project page
details upon request...

---

4) we can use https://glorious.codes/demo?ref=producthunt for creating more interactive and cool looking code samples.

---

5) The previous Gif that tried to explain how to use our plugin was bad. we need to have a new one...

Product Hunt text

We not just releasing the project to public, but also whole our collection. This collection have some interesting lists, related to food tech. You can see it here:

[Update text. not very nice]

Yes, you can do it in your way, but this is not very corrent(read fast) way.
When I creating my first recipe-app and my recipe server(both project was not launched yet)
I faced this problem: - problem with having a correct content stend with me all the time.
Like "Can I really grab this data and use or maybe I need to search for another data, etc."

When I find an Ultimate Grocery list website[link]
Anything start to be placed in a right place inside of my head. like "Here is a data, and your code can `dance around it` "

I know about one Protugal company from Portugal

I was in contact with their angel investor. In order to speed up their development process, the brought a US Food database for ~$4000. Each year they ship and update and it cost another ~$600. At that time I didn't realize that EU has a similar database, it's free and oepn. But this is another story to tell. So my current data was farmed from a different sources. Objects has different structures, used with different coding languages etc.
I'm putting all together and trying to learn from different examples. Like trying to put all in one blender, mix it and get a real juice.

And I was thinking: Hey, a lot of newbie food startups can benefit from this data. Why not to share them, right?

Next story:
I have a friend, he also working on his food projects.
He stores his code at Github.
We decided that in March we'll collaborate and launch something together.
Nowadays he creates a new sandbox repository. He testing there some new functionality.
I get a notification from github about his activity. I'm curious, so I take a look at his code. I figure out that he spend at least 2-4 hours of his time, in order to find a data, create a file, where he kept an array with static ingredients. I was like: "Damn! WTF! I have that data or data with very similar structure. Why he don't asked me about it? I'm definately want to help him and will be happy to share that data"

He faced the same problem that i have 2 years ago with recipe-app and recipe-server. We both don't have a real data to test our projects with.

I think this is a very common problem. A lot of people facing the same issues and other people has similar datasets and can share it too. Also, you can just dump a big archive in people faces and  - 'this is what i have - check it yourself'. You also need to teach people how this data can be used. It can save time and i decide that i should wrap my data into some holdays packaging paper.

Then I understand everything.
I realize that this is could be my first project, published on ProductHunt. Because my main project doesn't finished, and this data can help to the food community.
On a website, you'll see only clean data that I prepared at this moment. Dirty data are not disabled. But it contains much more data! At least in 3x. If this project with be useful to other people - i'll be happy to release a next version quickly.
