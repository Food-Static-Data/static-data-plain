For me NMTG was a big part of our NW journey, so I just cannot give up and don't try/
I understand that I let you down on Jan 2016, but i think I give you a lot of my energy
 before and this cannot be an option to not to try again.


Right now I'm thinking about different shares to offer to you.
I'm thinking about 20-30 percent maybe with addition option to buy later.
For my calculations, without any sales, business plan, etc - implemented project can cost $70-$100k right now.
I'll make a better business plan, sales pitch deck later, for sure. I have a
"custom" experience on last year, when NW was closed for a new projects.
But we cover all depts for our
clients(without additional money, curage and motivation) - so I'm back and ready to make a better business.

What you've also got - I'm thinking about section with promotion,
and if you'll be part of company.
You'll be able to gain some additional subscribers to NMTG.
Because I don't plan to have a chef who will
create meal plans - recipe content is our big weak.
But with my tech skills I'll cover all platform p

What else you'll got - as we will create an app and
I don't plan to hide any piece of code from you - you'll
receive all assets and I'll personaly build branded app for NMTG.
From your side you'll need only to create API to link app with your website.
This will add needs to code on NMTG side, so i think it will be cool for your business,
because any changes is good.
I wouldn't tell that app will make a big contribution to NMTG value,
 that you give to your user. I'm pretty sure that your users will be happy to have app too.

I also have a big list with ideas(really big, sometimes this make me worried) which I plan and start to implement. Right now I'm working on 5 my projects. Why not, I think - I can use similar functionality (login, registration, etc.) on all of that projects, and

But If we'll have a deal, I'll put more my energy on this project for sure.





Some numbers.
Let's set the lowest rate for my work - $10. This is not how I'm value my work, but this will give you an idea. Why $10. You remember that we have $20 per hour. But we pay salary to developers, salary to managers, office fee, Elance took 10% of commision, payment gateway took 5% because we don't have a good payment gateways in Ukraine, etc.
So let's asume that I can work on this project ~100 hours per month. it's $1000.
Code, that I have right now cost at least $1500. You also can check it out. I place it on public github account for now, because i don't think that right now somebody will be able to make money on it without me. Later I plan to hide it, for sure. It's security question.


Let's assume that I'll sell my services (hosting, completed application, client dashboard) to users for $100 (I don't create a good biz plan, but will do my analytics later). per month or $600 per year by one payment(I think 40% discount will be a good offer for start).
I'm pretty pessimistic with sales.

Let's assume that 10 users will register and use only first month of our service. It's bad way, but can illustrate my 'mind flow' about sales. This will be $1000. Let's remove 30% for some sort of commissions, other fees. Or 40%. By my experience - I can gain this users if i'll talk with 200 people and try to sell them this service. and this is a bad numbers. On Elance we store data how we itteract with users - how many emails we've send, how many replies we got, on what copy they replied most.
I'm telling you this information just to show that I can do this too.
So, we got 200 talks. How many times I'll need to contact somebody? Let's assume I'll send 1000 sales emails - 25% is good for convertion(replies with purchases), but not the best number. Let's set 13%, it's more than 10% - i think it's imposible in order to how much value and experience we'll give to our clients. So 2000 emails to different people.
I think this can take me 2 month to complete this work.

But this is 1-1 sales messages. This is not the best way to reach people - i think you know what i mean.
I plan to make some hype from different sources. Maybe deals on startup networks. Maybe advertising.
Submission on startup networks that I know will give views for sure, PR copy on different sources(right now i got list with 40 pr manager contacts - can share it with you)
I've got some views on our Twitter account, AngelList and Linkedin - so this will generate some revenue.
You know about this things - I've shared with you a lot of "trick or methods" about how to promote NMTG in past. I'm building strong community on Product Hunt, which will be a great to a such type of project. ProductHunt love  стартапы, которые только что запустились.

But let's assume that i need to send 2k emails in order to get 10 users for only one month. I hope I can do it better, but pessimistic option is always can be accomplished. So I'm ready to sale this "tool" and i have a big plan on it. Few days ago Gary Vaynerchuk show project, that i think he invest in - and it's a meal planning app with exclusive integration to grocery delivery service. I think it's a good sign.
You also can promote our product on NMTG, if you wish.

So in order to get $600 in first time - I'll spend 3k of my own min "salary". But product will be launched, so I can generate next sales, without worrying about coding.



It also can be a push to apply some changes to NMTG, by side. Like what you cannot do with your project - I will be able to do in easy way, because I know what "bottle neck" places you've got on NMTG. Like Grocery list, Search, complex logic of your database(because of custom plugin that you have).

I also want to build more than just one project, and see how they will shot. If some small project wouldn't make money - it will be easy to kill, if you have another one. So, by this offer I can promise to share with you offers to take part of company on other projects too. Maybe it's pretty early to talk and think about this. But we was in different situations together - so i don't worry about this promise.
Because it's better to sell 10% of company that cost mil, rather than have 50% of company that cost 0.





I don't want to push.
This is an exclusive offer. But this is also a good time to buy some shares. Because чем больше я погружаюсь в эту тему, и чем большее количество функционала я понимаю что я смогу интегрировать, а следовательно предлагать большие возможности, с удобным дизайном и моим personal approach - с которым вы сталкивались. Ведь вы знаете что я могу работать и ночью, когда вам это было нужно.

Вдруг я начну генерировать продажи раньше чем запушу основную часть проекта? Вдруг я нечайно найду инвестора, когда ктото сделает share в соц сетях - тогда разговор уже будет другой, т.к. у меня будет больше информации насчет того, сколько может стоить данная платформа.

Короче думайте, а я пошел добавлю еще функционала


It will be cool to get your "No".
Because it'll motivate me to continue, but i'll need to make some changes in my plan.
But I have backup plan for sure, for a lot of cases.
My prev experience with NW make me more hard and wiser.
Maybe I'll make a free plan for first 1000 users for 1 year or will
lauch Kickstarter company, or will start a pre-order with a good discount for bakers.

Failing in previous entrepreneurship is not a sign, that next will be successful.
But i got few insigths from investors. They using a different math formulas
for counting a company pre-valuation. But most of this formulas have an owner
coefficient. If it's a first time owner - he got 0 or 1. if owner have previous
bad background - he have 3. If he was succed - mark is 5.
But I'm also вооружен моим партнером, с которым мы несмотря не на что продолжаем
 работу. Ведь игра только началась.


I don't bluffing,  If you don't now - i was run a sales dept in NW with 3 sales managers.



And this is only one way to monetize - sell our services to Moms, who what to
build next NMTG(but do they have your courage, passion, терпеливость и желание учиться)?
 I think later, when functionality will be sharp - we also can sell API/Hosting.
 I don't want to sell branding things, because this will take me back to oursourcing.
  So maybe something we will give for free, and if somebody will want to apply
  changes on their own version of apps - they can download a full app code - give
  it to not affiliated developer to our company and make some changes.


My numbers(places where i'll try to promote & find a new users)
AngelList    - 1st degree connections - 1300, 35k second degree
Twitter      - 3k followers(more than you have:)
Linkedin     - 1st degree - 3400, 50k second degree
Product Hunt - 190 - i only started, but this is not important,
because we need to get featured on homepage to get a lot of traction.
list of other websites where i'll submit project profile.
Detailed list i'll post at Medium to open it to anybody.





I've also got a big experience in food. And for this moment we made more than
 3 project(one is not completed yet - local restaurants & local delivery directory)
  related to food tech.


I've made connection with one venture capitalist veteran from Chicago.
He worked with few nutritional statups (most of they have same schema of work
 - they buy database with nutrituon data(~$4000) of US products and build
 Food Tech products using that data). He gave me good advices and also tried
 to work with us. But right now his company don't have enough money,
 to outsource development and design, so maybe later i'll be a part of other project,
  related to healthy meal services. He was impressed and offer an opportunity
   together when he read my specification, that I was working on more that one week,
    related to functionaly to his main company - Nutricio. If you want -
    I can share to you contacts of him so you'll be able to chat with him too.

half week ago i've also made few connections on AngelList with owners of startups.

I've made a cool connection with few startups from Italia, they got my advices
for free, so maybe they can help me in future. I got a strong tech base,
but my experience to work with angel investors, incubators is low for this moment.
 But I'm willing to study it.

I've tried to offer them NW outsourcing services, but most of them have a
bad experience with outsourcing in past, so they wanted to keep development
in-house(And I understand that point of view).

I've got about 100 links to other small companies that working in Food Tech,
but I don't contact them right now.

I dont use your code, only logic that i got in my head
I also remeber that i've singed an NDA - so if you'll think that i'm using
some parts of NMTG intellectual property - you always will be able to sue me.

[intro]

[business part]

[your benefits]



[куда я планирую тратить деньги с вашей доли]
хостинг
домен
часть денег пойдет на ковер моей работы(небольшая часть), т.к. возможно нам нужна будет FB ads attack

I plan to add features from https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/8719172050165/houmous-vegan-apero-mieux-manger

so we can handle more inside simple app.
я хочу договорится с теми, кто учится делать видео контент чтобы нам чипово, но при этом много сделали видосиков по фуду.
скорее всего это должны быть обычные учебны видео или даже красивые слайды с рецептами.
--------------------------------------------------------

---
## We have similar stuff stored in someplace

Diets lovers
Allergies stuff
Local chiefs who made less than 20 food packages for busy families
detox addicted 😄
еще я хочу добавить artificial intelligence в одном из видов, чтобы облегчить ускорить чтото связанное с рецептами и едой

API with nutrition things
a lot of other businesseses, related to food market

online food directory from Amazon
food boxes

также данный функционал сможет стать жоступным для работы внутри NMTG ведь для приложения я сделаю просто интерфейс вывода данных(это потом легко можно будет добавить внутрь вашего сайта, полностью заменив устаревшие или сложно расширяемые фичи)




User asquision
mobile advertising platforms like clickky
affiliate network for apps
subscriptions for apps

languagels -> localize

facebook apps and autopublish

мамочки, которые хотят просто хранить свои рецепты в одном месте и пользоваться автоматическим GL / Financing tool

мамочки которые хотят заработать на подружках, работающие только для 10 user max, meal planning

weight loss doctors
sport/fitness trainers - they want to truck what their patients/students eat and how process is going

Ведет свой маленький wp сайт с едой и не против расширить свой функционал
с помощью нашей app - для таких можно давать бесплатно приложения, меняя это на какие то ништяки для нас. у них врятли будет много данных или пользователей, поэтому нет проблем. наверное для бесплатных пользователей нужно использовать нашу главную апп, а если уже они хотят платить - тогда будет их собственное приложение.

я бщался с инвестором из чикаго
Он запускает planner, ориентированный на докторов и фитнес тренеров

я также общался с теми, кто делает local chiefs delivery
я follow who creates a local restaurant find/liquor ordering
я знаю техническую часть вашего бизнеса с jill изнутри

потом я хотел бы сделать AI который бы решал различные функции
вместо человека на основе его вкусов и целей.

например у матери ребенка может быть минимум 4 цели
- накормить детей чем то разнообразным
- экономить деньги и время
- следить за фигурой своей
- хорошо(вкусно) кормить своего мужа


На что я ориентируюсь, когда думаю и делаю чтото в рамках данного продукта:
быстро и просто для мам.
Это новый подход, к которому я только сейчас привыкаю. использовать чтото,
 или добавлять только функционал, который можно просто и быстро создать.
  иначе он будет обречен на провал, т.к. много времени будет потрачено а результат не известен

хостинг данных и создание пиложений - отдельная тема или строка для доходов.

думаю еще я о приложениях для ресторанов.

возможное получение денег с рекламы внутри приложения.

тоесть если пользователь хочет просто делится рецептами бесплатно,
 но включать рекламу - это сложно но можно также сделать

куки, хуюки


как я думаю вывести вторую версию, в которой необходимо подключить ваших
существующих пользователей, без переноса всей базы и без создания аутентификации
 используя ваш вп сайт. скорее всего нужно сделать систему активационных кодов

важной информацией является то, что я не хочу ограничиваться вашим функционалом.
Как минимум он устарел, как максимум - это слишком скучно.
Без понимания того что я не применю и не сделаю ничего нового для вашей
индустрии - я бы не брался за этот проект и точно не предлагал бы вам долю.
Ведь в других проектах, которые я рассматриваю менее серьезно

Еще одна важная инфа - когда я писал вам в сентябре - мне нужны были личные деньги
Не стоит скрывать что я хотел получить их быстро используя нашу старую дружбу.
Этого не произошло и это не проблема. я предлагал вам тогда хорошие условия,
но возможно в неправильной форме или было неправильное время.


сейчас я не прошу денег себе на еду, я предлагаю попробывать
вы как минимум не потеряете большую сумму если ничего не получится.
как максимум вы закроете слабые дыры в вашем главном проекте и как
 побочный эффект вы сможете заработать немного денег себе, для дальнейшего развития NMTG.

сейчас я не хочу углубляться в какую то сильную и сложную тему
я задам пять направлений, которые буду развивать параллельно а потом
посмотрю какой из них будет приносить больше и на нем только сосрелоточусь.

будет приносить создание приложения - буду расширять его функционал и
продавать это как код
будет пользователям нравится меня как хостинг - улучшу этот процесс.
сделаю его более автоматическим

в фоод теме

я был бы не я, если бы расчитывал на быстрый рос без приложения большого количеста усилий

я сичтаю себя hard worker
поэтому у меня есть гторый маркетинг план
который делится на несколько вариантов,
в зависимости от денег - которые у меня будут на старте


уже сейчас у меня есть список из AL компаний, которые работают с food с
некоторыми я уже общался с другими нет
с теми с кем общался были удивлены моим опытом в фуд
при этом не были готовы работать - нанимать

в перспективе, разграничив направления, посмотреть какие будут лучше всего работать

большие надежды я связываю с restaurant delivery, food boxes delivery
fitness & diet management by doctors

плюсы- максимально просто все делать
простой план - А формат
расширенный план - Б формат

можно использовать нашу апп или например доплатить и используя код нашего
приложения - сделать свое, брендированное приложение
код будет такой же, но вы будете самостоятельнее
а платить будете и за код приложения и за годовые обновления и за хостинг
данных - если захотите

а потом будете платить только за хранения данных у нас

а мы сможем эти данные тоже сипользовать - заодно привлекать внимание к их мелким бизнесам
может делать какие то распродажи и т.д.

экспорт рецептов в csv,
в другие типы документов, чтобы потом можно было импортнуть

local chiefs, who want passive/additional income for sharing recipes to their community

prodject
hosting
app related stuff - notifications
good payments secure way

partly are at: https://medium.com/@arthurtkachenko/will-it-be-a-stealth-startup-if-ill-explain-what-i-plan-to-do-6c4fa37592de
What we have right now(at this moment)

our branded app
our web dashboard for storing your data and weekly menu management

using our angular repo with ionic
код можем отдавать чтобы програмисты его правили and build their own apps

we'll be able to create, submit and host your app

budget planner

subscriptions = payments

add bloggin feature
free recipes section
grocery delivery
cousines types

publish your recipe book and sell it

analytics how your users like /use your recipes

add groceries management + categories

add pantry management

support stuff

create APi for booking - delivery stuff

API
JSON
Хостинг
использовать наши алгоритмы
cooperation with delivery startups
shops who want to sell something

companies that want to improve their software or use our software

Companies, that have recipes/groceries in their businesses like NMTG, PID

restaurants can be interested to work together in meal delivery

doctors who manage patines
fitnerss


если уже и просить деньги
то я хочу пойти дальше, чем просто повторить ваш основной функционал.
 аля список рецептов и доставка

я бы хотел больше анализа данных
анализ покупок людей, еди и еще больше автоматизации, чтобы упросить жизнь тех,
кто придумывает эти рецепты

ну а если не пойдет, что более вероятно
нужно будет автоматизировать процесс шаринга в соц сетях, в первый год важным
 будет являтся выкладывание 10 обновлений функционала в год
понять что нужно пользователям и тогда делать уже выводы.


паралельно с этим проектом у меня есть идея, как поработать вместе с рестаранами
и что им можно предложить(у многих нет сайта с удобным поизком того, что они
готовят, нет формы заказа доставки, ни приложения с бонусами, акциями и нотификациями)

сам я им сайты уже делать не хочу, но думаю что можно найти людей, которые
хотят и будут также использовать наш код. а мы будем предоставлять услуги
хостинга и алгоритмы для их данных.

но это уже другая история

================================================
