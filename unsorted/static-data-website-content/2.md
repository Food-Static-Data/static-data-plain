1) I need to share stuff that i collected for in the last few years. Or my head will explode ;)
2) Money independence. After failing my prev company I decide to not go to 9-5 job and my friends supporting me financially. So I need to make it work :)
3) Health/fitness. I need to get in shape. At least 1/5 of my best form will be enough for now. Soon or later I should complete my 4th marathon.
4) I need to focus on money-making moves(it was a taboo for a few years) Find investors, incorporate company at EU
5) Continue to write my articles. Soon it will be 80. And hope before June 1st It will be around 100.
6) Launch my school, in order to strike back to Skillshare. details: https://hackernoon.com/skillshare-an-honest-review-of-my-experience-launching-a-coding-course-2d04f2975c9f
