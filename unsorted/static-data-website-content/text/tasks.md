I think that I don't want to have a `default` classes like below.
by my experience, they not perfect. and usually easy to be outdated.
if we need to get or set - we can use lodash _.get, _.set

ex from: https://github.com/andrewgrewell/structy

```
class Burger extends Model {
    constructor(data) {
        // call Model constructor and pass the burger data and fieldConfig
        super(data, burgerConfig);
    }

    // even though the consumer of this Burger Model could use Burger.name, it is better
    // to document the shape of your data via getters and setters.
    getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    isFavorite() {
        return this.favorite;
    }

    setFavorite(fav) {
        // note: setters are required since the data is immutable
        // this.favorite = fav will throw
        return this.set('favorite', fav);
    }
```

I was also thinking about incorporating immutablejs stuff, but it's not a good option for us too.

code gen at `files`: create a hash map, similar that we have at search.js for returning all raw files.... it'll avoid issues with updating t by hands.

create method that will `_.unite` all attributes into one file.
as we need it...

files have work with json5 spec: https://json5.org/

install and use: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile

or

https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-json-file

https://github.com/sindresorhus/parse-json


codegen of db with recipes. like we have a db-recipes and we actually convert the structure to match with our schema.
but what if someone what to have a different scheme. for this case we can actually use graphql server that will return data in different ways. maybe we need to have a wizard, that will send updated query and by result we'll send a json file to user...

check `node-csv`

2nd generation of the plugin: https://github.com/GroceriStar/fetch2

set of constants that we'll use: https://github.com/GroceriStar/fetch-constants

@TODO complete json validation at jsonlint.config.js right now i stuck with paths. And i'm on Windows and it's not an ideal conditions for package that works at unix systems
